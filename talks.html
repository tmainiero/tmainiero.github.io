				Is the frowzy state of your desk no longer as thrilling as it once was?
				Are numerical measures of information no longer able to satisfy your needs?
				There is a cure!
				In this talk we'll learn about: the secret topological lives of multipartite measures and quantum states;
				how a homological probe of this geometry reveals correlated random variables;
				the sly decategorified involvement of Shannon, Tsallis, RÃ©yni, and von Neumann in this larger geometric conspiracy;
				and the story of how Gelfand, Neumark, and Segal's construction of von Neumann algebra representations can help us uncover this informatic ruse.
				So come to this talk, spice up your entropic life, and bring new meaning to your relationship with disarray.

				N=2 SU(3) Super-Yang-Mills possesses a rather unexpected property: the number of BPS states of mass less than M grows exponentially with M; moreover, the states contributing to this large growth in the density of states represent bound states that become arbitrarily large in size.
				We will discuss the techniques used to derive this result (which may generalize far beyond N=2 SU(3) SYM)&mdash;focusing on the machinery of spectral networks&mdash;and some possible consequences.

					In the futuristic year 2023, an ex cohomological cop (Harrison Ford) is pulled out of retirement to track down obstructions to the factorizability of multipartite measures: entangled states and their classical counterparts...joint probability measures.
					A vast conspiracy is uncovered: associated to every multipartite measure is an emergent space whose topology encodes non-local correlations between various subsystems.
					Probing this space with tools with homology, homotopy, and category theory reveals evidence that entropy and mutual information are Euler characteristics: puppets in a larger informatic ruse.

				1982: Freddie Mercury is still the lead vocalist for Queen and Ed Witten provides a physical interpretation of the Morse-Smale complex in "Supersymmetry and Morse Theory".
				I'll give a colloquium-style overview of this historic paper (from a modern, retrospective viewpoint); outlining how de Rham cohomology of a compact smooth manifold can be extracted from the study of the (supersymmetric) quantum mechanics of a point particle living on that manifold, and how Morse homology arises as a "classical limit" of this theory.
				Such ideas formed the basis for the development of Floer homology, among other things.
				Familiarity with physics terminology will be useful, but not necessary; similarly an appreciation for synthesizers and reverence of Reagan are not required.

				It is a result of Kontsevich and Soibelman that generating functions for Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants associated to the m-Kronecker quiver are algebraic functions over the rationals.  Using a technique from supersymmetric physics-- "spectral networks" -- one can see algebraicity of such functions directly and construct the associated algebraic equations in an algorithmic manner.  We will discuss some interesting corollaries of these algebraic equations-- namely asymptotics on DT-invariants and Euler-characteristics of (Kronecker) quiver moduli-- and (if time allows) give a brief overview of the spectral network technique.

				We will recap the main ideas of the previous talks (so don't worry if you haven't seen them or cannot remember much).
				We'll introduce presheaves of vector spaces from the data of a multipartite state and show how the associated Cech cochain complexes are the complexes predicted from previous talks.
				The cohomology of such complexes outputs tuples of operators that exhibit non-local correlations caused by entanglement.
				If there is time we will make brief mention about the classical analogues of this construction, where the cohomology is the cohomology of an actual space.

				This is the first part of an N-part series about entanglement and homological algebra; here N is large and equal to 2 or 3.
				After a short overview, we will encounter the mutual information of a multipartite density state as measure of "entanglement" (more precisely: lack of factorizability).
				It leads a secret life as the limit of a triholomorphic index that is invariant under local unitary (or invertible) transformations and plays nicely with tensor products and "classical sums".
				What else is it hiding?

				In the futuristic year 2017 Piscataway, NJ is a depressing metropolis filled with urban decay.  An ex-Cohomological cop (Harrison Ford) is pulled out of retirement to track down obstructions to the calculation of expectation values in terms of local quantities, caused by the presence of  entangled states that came to the planet Earth in search of non-local correlations.  With the help of C*-algebra representation theory of Gelfand, Naimark, and Segal, he closes in on a chain complex outputting obstructions to factorizability in the form of tuples of multi-body non-locally correlated operators---but his hatred for numerical valued quantities is called into question when he realizes the Euler characteristic is related to (q-deformations of) multivariate mutual information.

				The Riemann-Hilbert correspondence is a statement about a correspondence between the study of flat connections on bundles over a manifold X, and representations of its fundamental group(oid).
				In the case that X is a complex curve, however, many folks take pleasure in the study of the fancier world of flat connections with singularities bounded by some divisor D &lt; X.
				Gualtieri, Li, and Pym (1305.7288) state that in this world, the appropriate Riemann-Hilbert correspondence tells us that the study of such flat connections is the study of representations of a groupoid \Pi(X,D).
				Despite all of the "oiding," the results are quite simple and reveal a beautiful (and "functorial") way to take formal power series solutions (of flat sections) to honest solutions by looking at pull-backs to the groupoid \Pi(X,D).
