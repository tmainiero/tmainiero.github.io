				N=2 SU(3) Super-Yang-Mills possesses a rather unexpected property: the number of BPS states of mass less than M grows exponentially with M; moreover, the states contributing to this large growth in the density of states represent bound states that become arbitrarily large in size.
				We will discuss the techniques used to derive this result (which may generalize far beyond N=2 SU(3) SYM)&mdash;focusing on the machinery of spectral networks&mdash;and some possible consequences.

					That guy who retired at 25 to Sedona to practice reading auras of upside-down cerebral crystal nudists practicing cannabis yoga might have accidentally said something relevant to physics: space can emerge from the connectedness of things.
					I will describe how a topological space emerges from a question about independence of random variables; the topology/geometry encodes information about correlations.
					This story is the classical version of a quantum mechanical one, and is inspired by research into the relationship of entangled states and non-trivial geometries of space-time.
					Just don't encourage that guy.

					<p> Boolean algebras: your grandma has been hyping them up since the 1930's.  
					But you're still not convinced that you can afford the quantity coffee that would keep you awake for her logic lectures, in-between her snoring sessions on the couch.
					That is, until you hear about Stone duality: every Boolean algebra lives a double life as an oddball topological space.
					It doesn't get much attention, but Stone duality is part of the larger theme of the duality between algebras and spaces.
					During my talk, I'll channel your grandma to describe Stone duality and, time-permitting, it's relation to measure theory as well as how it relates to other duality theorems.

				1982: Freddie Mercury is still the lead vocalist for Queen and Ed Witten provides a physical interpretation of the Morse-Smale complex in "Supersymmetry and Morse Theory".
				I'll give a colloquium-style overview of this historic paper (from a modern, retrospective viewpoint); outlining how de Rham cohomology of a compact smooth manifold can be extracted from the study of the (supersymmetric) quantum mechanics of a point particle living on that manifold, and how Morse homology arises as a "classical limit" of this theory.
				Such ideas formed the basis for the development of Floer homology, among other things.
				Familiarity with physics terminology will be useful, but not necessary; similarly an appreciation for synthesizers and reverence of Reagan are not required.

				Nowadays the idea of entanglement being related to non-trivial geometries or topologies is about as surprising as a solitary carrot.
				Typically global/topologically non-trivial data can be extracted from a (co)homology theory.
				I will describe some ideas and partial results relating to why (multipartite) entanglement may be encoded in a homology theory and the dream of extracting entanglement entropy (more accurately: mutual information) as the Euler characteristic of a chain complex.
				This talk will be just linear algebra, not an attempt to put you to sleep with a jargon lullaby.

				In the futuristic year 2017 Piscataway, NJ is a depressing metropolis filled with urban decay.  An ex-Cohomological cop (Harrison Ford) is pulled out of retirement to track down obstructions to the calculation of expectation values in terms of local quantities, caused by the presence of  entangled states that came to the planet Earth in search of non-local correlations.  With the help of C*-algebra representation theory of Gelfand, Naimark, and Segal, he closes in on a chain complex outputting obstructions to factorizability in the form of tuples of multi-body non-locally correlated operators---but his hatred for numerical valued quantities is called into question when he realizes the Euler characteristic is related to (q-deformations of) multivariate mutual information.

				It is a result of Kontsevich and Soibelman that generating functions for Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants associated to the m-Kronecker quiver are algebraic functions over the rationals.  Using a technique from supersymmetric physics-- "spectral networks" -- one can see algebraicity of such functions directly and construct the associated algebraic equations in an algorithmic manner.  We will discuss some interesting corollaries of these algebraic equations-- namely asymptotics on DT-invariants and Euler-characteristics of (Kronecker) quiver moduli-- and (if time allows) give a brief overview of the spectral network technique.
